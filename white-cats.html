        Should you get an White cats?
    </h2>
    <p>
        White cats are undeniably beautiful, often having striking eye colors like blue, green, or gold. 
        Some breeds, like Turkish Angoras or Maine Coons, have gorgeous fluffy coats, while others, like Siamese or Cornish Rex, have sleeker appearances.
        However, there are some things to consider. 
        White cats, especially those with blue eyes, can have a higher chance of deafness due to genetics. 
        This doesn’t mean they can’t live happy, fulfilling lives—it just requires some adjustments in communication and care. 
        Their pristine coats also tend to highlight dirt more, so they may need extra grooming to keep them looking their best.
        Ultimately, if you love the idea of a white cat and are prepared to care for their needs, they can be a fantastic choice
